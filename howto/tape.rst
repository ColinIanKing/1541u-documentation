How do I use T64 files ?
........................
T64 is a file format, or rather a container, just like D64 disk image. Unfortunately the U2 and U2+ does not recognise it as such. This means that you cannot open this container using the return key and then choose enter.

Instead, you can use the right cursor key to enter the T64 container and then press return to have the contextual menu pop up and choose run to run the c64 programme.
