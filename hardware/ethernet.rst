The ethernet port can be connected to a switch ( or hub ) to communicate with the Ultimate-64 over your own network.

In the configuration menu ( Network settings ) you can change several setting regarding this port.

Some of you may be familiar with the RR-net solution that brings Ethernet to the C-64. Currently, the built-in Ethernet port does not provide RR-net compatibility. However:

The Ethernet port is used natively by the firmware 
..................................................

There is some primitive support for file-transfer using FTP (needs improvement), and it is possible to connect to the Ultimate-II+ using a VT-100 terminal 
program on the Telnet port (port 23). This gives the possibility to control the machine remotely, and swap disks without actually interrupting the program 
running on the C-64.
